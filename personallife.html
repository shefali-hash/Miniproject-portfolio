     	 The actor has had a series of alleged affairs and link-ups before he tied the knot with Rajesh Khanna and Dimple Kapadia`s elder daughter <b>Twinkle Khanna</b>in 2001. 
         Much before getting married, Akshay was apparently dating then well-known model <b>Pooja Batra</b>. The two were in a relationship before Akshay entered the industry. 
         Soon after Kumar started working in Bollywood, his relationship with Pooja fizzled off.
      
      <br><br>Upon starting his career in Bollywood, he allegedly started dating his Khiladi co-star Ayesha Jhulka. 
It was his affair with the 90`s bombshell Raveena Tandon that grabbed the limelight. 
The two actors dated for three years before Tandon broke up with him over his flirtatious habits.
The actress also reportedly said in an exclusive interview that the two were secretly engaged, but she had found out that Kumar was, in fact, cheating on her with two other women.

<br><br>
However, after he split with Raveena, he started dating <b>Shilpa Shetty</b>. 
The two created magic on-screen and their romance bloomed off-screen too.
But after dating Kumar for a year, Shetty called off her relationship with him when she found out that he was cheating on her with her best friend, Twinkle Khanna. 
The Khiladi then finally tied the knot with Twinkle Khanna and the two have <b>two children</b> together - <b>Aarav and Nitara</b>. 
He believes in providing a normal childhood to his children and, therefore, tries to keep them away from unwanted media attention.

<br><br>
The Khiladi follows a disciplined lifestyle and makes it a point to wake up before sunrise and practice kickboxing, basketball, Parkour, and martial arts to stay fit.
