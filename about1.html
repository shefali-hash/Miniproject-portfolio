     <p>Kumar was born in Amritsar, Punjab, India,to Hari Om Bhatia and Aruna Bhatia in a Punjabi family. His father was an army officer.From a young age, Kumar as very interested in sports. His father too enjoyed wrestling. He lived and grew up in Delhi's Chandni Chowk and later he moved to Bombay (present-day Mumbai) when his father left Army to become an accountant with UNICEF. Soon, his sister was born and the family lived in Koliwada, a Punjabi dominated area of Central Bombay.

<br><br>He received his school education from Don Bosco High School, Matunga,simultaneously learning Karate. He enrolled in Guru Nanak Khalsa College for higher education, but dropped out as he was not much interested in studies. He requested his father that he wanted to learn martial arts further, and his father somehow saved money to send him to Thailand. Kumar went to Bangkok to learn martial arts and lived in Thailand for five years learning Thai Boxing.Kumar also has a sister, Alka Bhatia.
<br><br>When Kumar was a teenager, his father asked him what he aspired to be. Kumar expressed his desire to become an actor. After having obtained a black belt in Taekwondo while in India,he studied martial arts in Bangkok, Thailand, where he learned Muay Thai and worked as a chef and waiter. 
After Thailand, Kumar went to work in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata) in a travel agency, in Dhaka in a hotel and Delhi where he sold Kundan jewellery. Upon his return to Bombay, he commenced the teaching of martial arts.

<br><br>During this time, the father of one of his students, himself a model co-ordinator, recommended Kumar into modelling which ultimately led to a modelling assignment for a furniture showroom. Kumar effectively made more money within the first two days of shooting than in his entire month's salary, and therefore chose a modelling career path. He worked as an assistant for photographer Jayesh Sheth for 18 months without payment to shoot his first portfolio.
He also worked as a background dancer in various films.One morning, he missed his flight for an ad-shoot in Bangalore. Disappointed with himself, he visited a film studio along with his portfolio.

<br><br>That evening, Kumar was signed for a lead role by producer Pramod Chakravarthy for the movie Deedar
